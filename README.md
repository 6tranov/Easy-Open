# Demo

# Description
## Background
Judging the search results by the title and the beginning alone can lead to missing valuable information, but I found it very annoying to open all the links manually. This extension allows you to open all the search results displayed on the page at once with one click. If you want to see additional search results, tabs will open in the same window.
## Features
- Display all search results with one click.
- If the search result tab is not in a separate window, that tab will be moved to the newly opened window.
